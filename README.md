# PhononCode

Calculates Lattice Thermal Conductivity and band structure of an arbitrary 1D chain of atoms with arbitrary defect type, concentration and distribution.

Parameters must be modified directly in the code.

The code is parallelizable up to n the number of primittive cell in the super cell. 

Requires: numpy, matplotlib, mpi4py, scipy
